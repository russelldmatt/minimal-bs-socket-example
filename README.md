This is a minimal working example of a client and server (in reason)
communicating via
[bs-socket](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-socket.io).

To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/russelldmatt/minimal-bs-socket-example.git
cd minimal-bs-socket-example
npm install
npm run build
node src/Server.bs.js
# browse to localhost:3000
# view stdout for server
```
